## Plot 2: US Population and Unemployment, 2015-2018
![figure 2](Figure_2.png)

This bar plot compares the population data and number of unemployed people in the US in the years 2015 to 2018. Both numbers are increasing. It would be interesting to see more recent data on unemployment from 2020 to visualize the effects of COVID-19 on unemployment numbers.
